This is a KParts-based Okular plugin designed to work as a Firefox
compatible plugin.

It uses Nokia's QtBrowserPlugin, part of Qt Solutions

Build instructions:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ make install

Make sure that libokularplugin.so is in your mozilla/firefox plugins path

e.g.
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/.mozilla/plugins
$ ln -s /usr/lib/libokularplugin.so ${HOME}/.mozilla/plugins

You'll need to make /usr/lib/libokularplugin.so point to the file
which was installed by the make install step above.
